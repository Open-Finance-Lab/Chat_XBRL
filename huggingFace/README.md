This program takes in a YML file and extracts the name, producer, classification, last updated, and badge. It then converts the model data to a data frame. 

The initial issue with this code was that classification and badge were outputting as null and empty. The resolution for this bug was that there was no classification or badge key in the YML file. A solution to this was to input classification in each YML file. This was tedious and required me to go through every YML file. A second solution was to create a web scraping program to extract the classifcation and badges to put onto the data frame. While this took more logic and code, it was entirely more efficient for future classifications and badges. 

This entire pipeline was integrated with the Model Openness Tool (MOT) on Hugging Face. I took the initial code from MOT, refactored it, and added error handling and automated data population for missing fields, effectively eliminating the bugs that had previously caused missing or inaccurate data. The enhancements ensure that the extracted data is complete and accurate, making it readily usable for evaluation and display in MOT applications. This approach not only saves time but also enhances the reliability of the data extraction process, helping to maintain consistent model metadata across the framework.
